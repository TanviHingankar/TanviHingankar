<h1 style="color: blueviolet;">OSI 7 Layers :</h1>
<hr style="width: 100%;">

<dl>
  <dt>1.Physical Layer :-</dt>
  <dd>The physical layer refers to the physical communication medium and the technologies to transmit data across that medium.At its core, data communication is the transfer of digital and electronic signals through various physical channels like fiber-optic cables, copper cabling, and air. The physical layer includes standards for technologies and metrics closely related with the channels, such as Bluetooth, NFC, and data transmission speeds. </dd>
  <br>
  <dt>2.Data link layer :-</dt>
  <dd>The data link layer refers to the technologies used to connect two machines across a network where the physical layer already exists.Flow control and error control of data are often key focuses of the data link layer. Ethernet is an example of a standard at this level. </dd>
  <br>
  <dt>3.Network Layer :-</dt>
  <dd>The network layer is concerned with concepts such as routing, forwarding, and addressing across a dispersed network or multiple connected networks of nodes or machines. The network layer may also manage flow control. Across the internet, the Internet Protocol v4 (IPv4) and IPv6 are used as the main network layer protocols</dd>
  <br>
  <dt>4.Transport Layer :-</dt>
  <dd>The primary focus of the transport layer is to ensure that data packets arrive in the right order, without losses or errors, or can be seamlessly recovered if required. Flow control, along with error control, is often a focus at the transport layer. </dd>
  <br>
  <dt>5.Session Layer :-</dt>
  <dd>The session layer is responsible for network coordination between two separate applications in a session. A session manages the beginning and ending of a one-to-one application connection and synchronization conflicts.  </dd>
  <br>
  <dt>6.Presentation Layer :-</dt>
  <dd>The presentation layer is primarily concerned with the syntax of the data itself for applications to send and consume. For example, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), JavaScipt Object Notation (JSON), and Comma Separated Values (CSV) are all modeling languages to describe the structure of data at the presentation layer. </dd>
  <br>
  <dt>7.Application Layer :-</dt>
  <dd>The application layer is concerned with the specific type of application itself and its standardized communication methods. For example, browsers can communicate using HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), and HTTP and email clients can communicate using POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).</dd>
